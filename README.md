# Interject Billing Manager

Billing management system created by me for Interject. The project is written in SQL Server, but integrates directly with the Interject Excel Add-in and Interject Data Portal software layer, so it will not be runnable by those who are not Interject users.

## How to View this Project

This project is written in SQL Server, but integrates directly with the Interject Excel Add-in and Interject Data Portal software layer, so it will not be runnable by those who are not Interject users. To best understand the problem and my solutions, first see the Excel sheet located in ./report, then consult the SQL code organized by its corresponding tab on the Excel sheet located in ./src.

## Problem Description

The problem of billing clients was previously handled manually and became cumbersome at Interject. The probelm of "billing" as I refer to it here includes:
1. Keeping track of their license agreements (licensing of the Interject software) and how they change year-to-year (or quarter-to-quarter)

## Note on Commit History

This repository unfortunately does not preserve the original commit history because certain development files were excluded from public view and only the final project code is published here. The project code is, however, complete.
